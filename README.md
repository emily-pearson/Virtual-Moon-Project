The final codes uploaded for this virtual moon project consist of 3 MATLAB files and 3 ARDUINO files. These are explained as follows:

MATLAB codes:
- the VIRTUAL_MOON_MAIN code is the code used to interface with the Arduino and begin the experiment
- the DATA_PROCESSING code take a stored Excel results file (with experimental data from the mock end station) and generates results graphs
- the ROYCE_DATA_PROCESSING code is used to process hand-entered data when experimenting with the Royce end station

ARDUINO codes:
- the VIRTUAL_MOON_MAIN_ARDUINO code is the primary code to control the electronics for the experiment
- the PURGE_MFC code can be used as a simple code to turn on gas flow in the heat exchanger gas feed line
- the PURGE_BYPASS code can be used as a simple code to turn on gas flow in the bypass gas feed line
Together, the purge codes can be used as simple controls for the Royce end station (using the main code on the Royce is not currently possible as the thermocouple there is N-type)

In addition, all raw data Excel files for the 11 tests described in the documentation are uploaded for reference
Figures and images used in the documentation are also uploaded (figures are in the file formats .png or .tif)
A powerpoint presentation given at the end of the summer internship is included

An extensive written report containing all findings and recommendations is included. This should be referred to as needed before continuing work on this project.
